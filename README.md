#### This is a project to analyize the temperature from several weather stations in Hawaii. The first part is the analysis in Jupyter notebook and the second part using Flask (app.py)

### First Part: Jupyter Notebook
#### There were two sub parts in this part. The first analysis with the precipitation including a graph showing the precipitation data from the past 12 months from the most recent date in the date set. It was completed with a simple statistical summary

### Second Part: Flask
#### There was a simple analysis like determine the most active station, the total number of stations, statistical summary for temps in the most active station etc.. Lastly, there is a histogram (with 12 bins) to show the frequency of temperature at the most active station.
